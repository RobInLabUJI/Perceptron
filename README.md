*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

The [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers (functions that can decide whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class or not). It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The algorithm allows for online learning, in that it processes elements in the training set one at a time.

The perceptron algorithm dates back to the late 1950s; its first implementation, in custom hardware, was one of the first artificial neural networks to be produced.

## Activities

You should run first the example of the AND function, then complete with a similar code the exercises of the OR function and the linearly separable classes.

* [Example: the AND function](AND.ipynb)
* [Exercise: the OR function](OR.ipynb)
* [Exercise: linearly separable classes](Classes.ipynb)

For the submission of this task, please follow the instructions of the corresponding workshop in Aula Virtual.
